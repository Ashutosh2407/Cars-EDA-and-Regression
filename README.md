# Cars-EDA-and-Regression

A Jupyter notebook where I performed a exploratory data analysis along with regression analysis on a comprehensive Automobile business dataset. This project involves:<br/>

🔍 Data Exploration: Identifying key features and understanding the relationships between variables using Pandas library.<br/>

🔍 Feature Engineering: Using Decision trees to find out the importance of each attribute and weed out the unnecessary ones. <br/>

📈 Model Building: Implementing Extra Tress Regressor to predict car prices based on various attributes.<br/>

📊 Insights: Uncovering trends and patterns that could influence resale value of an automobile in the used automotive industry.<br/>

🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.<br/>
